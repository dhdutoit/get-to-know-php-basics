# get-to-know-php-basics
A small introduction to PHP. We are starting to build up an incubator for new devs who may not be skilled in either PHP or developmeny (in general); and would like to provide them with an online guide they can work though to catch up on dev and the language.

The goal of this is to be built up, with experience gained by training new members of the team, in order to become a comprehensive guide for PHP developers in our department. We would like to be able to share it with ANYONE in the company (from call centre agent to ORACLE dev) who may want to learn more about development and/or PHP as a language.

The structure of this introduction to PHP will be various section covering various parts of what one would need to know of in order to start coding in PHP. Each section will have a README that will explain that part of the language (or attempt to) as well as any execises or instructions to follow. Each of the sections will also contain basic PHP files as examples of the code for each part.

The intent is also to add exercises that could be be completed and unit tests that could be run to see how well the provided code is written. :) (cause early exposure to unit tests is never a bad thing)
