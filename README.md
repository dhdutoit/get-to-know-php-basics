# get-to-know-php-basics
A small introduction to PHP. We are starting to build up an incubator for new devs who may not be skilled in either PHP or developmeny (in general); and would like to provide them with an online guide they can work though to catch up on dev and the language.

The goal of this is to be built up, with experience gained by training new members of the team, in order to become a comprehensive guide for PHP developers in our department. We would like to be able to share it with ANYONE in the company (from call centre agent to ORACLE dev) who may want to learn more about development and/or PHP as a language.
