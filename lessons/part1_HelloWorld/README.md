# Why does the World never greet back?

PHP is an open-source, general use, scripting language that is well suited for web development.

PHP is a recursive acronym for: *PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor*.

PHP files end with the extention *.php*.

PHP files can also contain other scripting languages like JavaScript and HTML.

PHP files always start with `<?php`; and used to end with `?>`, but with recent versions we no longer need the closing language tag.

Every line of code ends with `;` and the compiler doesnt care much for white spaces, so you can have code on the same line or a new line as long as you show which sections of end with a `;`.

Sinlge line comments are denoted with `//` while multiline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Example 1 shows a basic hello world with some additional HTML in it. (the `\n` is to tell the command line to make a new line)

Example 2 shows a hello world that uses a variable.
