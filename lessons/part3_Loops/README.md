# The very basics of loops in PHP

1. For loop
2. For..each loop
3. While loop
4. While..do loop

The basic way of looping over/through list or groups of data and variables can be done with these basic looping methods.

They all do the same thing, just in different ways, so they can be used for different approaches or different available data.

Examples for each are availabe in the examples files.
