# Oject Inheritance.

In a nutshell one class can inherit from another class. Much like a child would inherit things from a parent.

A subclass inherits all of the public and protected methods from the parent class. Unless a class overrides those methods, they will retain their original functionality.

Inheritance in a basic approach to abstraction of code, wich is part of the bigger picture of object orientated programming.
