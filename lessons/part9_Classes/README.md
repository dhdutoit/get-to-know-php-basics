# Classes and the MAGIG of object orientated programming (OOP)

Basic class definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.

A class may contain its own constants, variables (called "properties"), and functions (called "methods").
